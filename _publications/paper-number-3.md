# excerpt: 'The coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19, is a complex disease with a wide range of symptoms from asymptomatic infections to severe acute respiratory syndrome with lethal outcome. Individual factors such as age, sex, and comorbidities increase the risk for severe infections, but other aspects, such as genetic variations, are also likely to affect the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity. Here, we used a human 3D lung cell model based on primary cells derived from multiple donors to identity host factors that regulate SARS-CoV-2 infection. With a transcriptomics-based approach, we found that less susceptible donors show a higher expression level of serine protease inhibitors SERPINA1, SERPINE1, and SERPINE2, identifying variation in cellular serpin levels as restricting host factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We pinpoint their antiviral mechanism of action to inhibition of the cellular serine …'
